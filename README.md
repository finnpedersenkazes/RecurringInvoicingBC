# Recurring Invoicing in Business Central
This project aims to implement a simple yet useful Subscription functionality using Blanket Orders in Microsoft 365 Business Central. 

This will allow the user to make recurring invoicing of items, whether they are service items or ordinary items. The Blanket Order serves as a contract, where the user can follow what has already been invoice and what will be invoice next. Any subscription can be put on hold by simply setting the Subscription Type to `Stop`.
